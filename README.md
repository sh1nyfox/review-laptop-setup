A WIP script to help me setup review laptops for my day job a lot quicker. 

Any advice on how to streamline the process will be greatfully received. I'm a complete noob but I'm starting to learn!

Current plan: 

- Set Execution Policy
- Install Chocolately
- Pull various packages for gaming, benchmarking, everyday use
- Split off forks for different types of laptop (gaming, Ultrabooks etc)
